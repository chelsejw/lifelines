# Lifelines

### How the idea for Lifelines came about
Appeals for blood donors often go unnoticed unless an owner with an eligible pet notices it on their social media timelines, which might not happen due to unhelpful algorithms.

Additionally, vet clinics are also limited to appealing for donations only through their own client base.


### What does Lifeline hope to do?
- Streamline the process of finding pet blood donors in Singapore
- Ensure notices for appeals reach as many eyes as possible, especially those of people with blood donor-eligible pets (e.g. for dogs, they usually need to be above 20-30kg), *through notifications on their preferred platforms* (e.g. WhatsApp, email)
- Save as many lives as possible!
- Allow veterinary clinics to tap on blood donors outside of their existing clients
