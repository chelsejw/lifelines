## Approach and Process
### What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
- Be more realistic about what I can achieve
- If there's a lot to achieve, don't try to use unnecessary libraries

### What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?

- I'm not sure anything went well to be honest!
- But I am proud of myself for trying out a lot of new things

## Code and Code Design
### What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

- Be more deliberate about the kind of states I need. Plan it out carefully instead of creating new ones on the fly whenever I need specific information, leading to a heap of messy states.

- Have more 'dumb' / purely presentational components

- My project is a crazy mix of Redux, hooks, and vanilla React state management right now.

- I could have tried to implement ActionCable with Rails views from the get go since it is not so widely done in React. (And hence harder to troubleshoot)


### What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

- Hmm... I really don't know if anything went well. My code is in shambles.


# SEI Unit 4 Post Mortem

## What habits did I use during SEI that helped me, that I will take on to my future coding projects?

- Debugger, byebug, etc. 
- Break down a big project into a million small steps
- Make a schedule of daily milestones to hit for every coding sprint/project

## What habits did I have during SEI I can improve on that I will try to change on future projects?

- Just going with 'whatever works' -- I need practice writing more clean, concise code, but I often don't have enough time
- Refactoring should be an essential to-do for all my projects
- Should do my best to understand how the technology I'm using works, so that I don't have to depend on some random StackOverflow user who had the exact same problem as me to have asked about it by the time I encounter some error (this is mainly ActionCable, which I still don't think I understand properly, and hence I was unable to get it working by the deadline.)
- 

## How is the overall level of the course? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

- Even if I don't get a job in 6 months, I don't think I'll regret having attended SEI. :')
